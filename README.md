## Example Usage 🖥️

```javascript
// Import the snanmax function from the stats-strided-snanmax library
const { snanmax } = require('stats-strided-snanmax');

// Define a sample strided array with NaN values
const data = new Float32Array([1.5, 2.0, NaN, 3.8, 4.2, NaN, 5.6]);

// Calculate the maximum value ignoring NaN values
const result = snanmax(data);

console.log(result); // Output: 5.6
```

In this example, we utilize the `snanmax` function to find the maximum value in a strided array `data`, disregarding any NaN values present in the array.
